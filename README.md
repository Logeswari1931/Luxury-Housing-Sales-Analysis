🏠 Luxury Housing Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete real estate analytics solution by integrating Python, SQL, and Power BI. The focus is on analyzing luxury housing sales data (100,000+ records) in Bengaluru, India, to extract insights on pricing trends, demand patterns, and location-based sales performance.

The solution simulates an enterprise-level data pipeline, covering the entire journey from raw dataset to interactive dashboards:

Data Cleaning & Transformation using Python.

Database Integration by loading refined data into SQL.

Visualization & Reporting using Power BI connected directly to SQL.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python → Data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation.

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) → Data storage, querying, and integration with BI tools.

Power BI → Interactive dashboards and data visualization.

📂 Project Structure

data/ → Raw dataset files.

notebooks/ → Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning.

sql/ → SQL schema and queries used to create and populate database tables.

dashboard/ → Power BI file (bangaluru house logeshwari.pbix).

README.md → Project documentation (this file).

🚀 Workflow

Data Preparation (Python)

Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

Normalize and standardize features (price, size, location, etc.).

Export cleaned dataset as .csv for SQL loading.

Database Management (SQL)

Create database schema for housing dataset.

Load refined data into SQL tables.

Write queries for aggregations (avg price per sqft, top locations, etc.).

Visualization (Power BI)

Connect Power BI directly to SQL database.

Build dashboards to explore:

Price trends across locations.

Demand vs. supply analysis.

Luxury housing affordability index.

Enable drill-down and interactive filtering.

📊 Key Insights (Example)

Location significantly influences property price.

High demand areas show strong price appreciation trends.

Luxury housing segment (>₹1 Cr) contributes majorly to sales volume.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Automate pipeline with ETL workflows (Airflow/SSIS).

Integrate machine learning models for price prediction.

Deploy Power BI Service for real-time data refresh and sharing.
